This is a machine learning model which predict the price of house in a city based on various housing parameters as per the requirement
of the buyers. This house price prediction model is made by using linear regression. I had taken a Housing Dataset for training my 
Machine Learning model. As our data have various parameters like area, number of bedrooms,no of bathrooms, furnishing status, mainroad or not on mainroad etc.
Since it is a python project it requires various python libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn etc.
I developed this project as a final project to of the Bootcamp conducted by Devtown. This is verified by DevTown.
This model is now hosted of the internet using python flask and Heroku.
